-        
-        Mutmut is a mutation testing system for Python, with a strong focus on ease
-        of use. If you don't know what mutation testing is try starting with
-        `this article <https://hackernoon.com/mutmut-a-python-mutation-testing-system-9b9639356c78>`_.
-        
-        Some highlight features:
-        
-        - Found mutants can be applied on disk with a simple command making it very
-          easy to work with the results
-        - Remembers work that has been done, so you can work incrementally
-        - Supports all test runners (because mutmut only needs an exit code from the
-          test command)
-        - If you use the `hammett <https://github.com/boxed/hammett>`_ test runner
-          you can go extremely fast! There's special handling for this runner
-          that has some pretty dramatic results.
-        - Can use coverage data to only do mutation testing on covered lines
-        - Battle tested on real libraries by multiple companies
-        
-        
-        If you need to run mutmut on a python 2 code base use mutmut ``1.5.0``. Mutmut
-        ``1.9.0`` is the last version to support python ``3.4``, ``3.5`` and ``3.6``.
-        
-        
-        Install and run
-        ---------------
-        
-        You can get started with a simple:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            pip install mutmut
-            mutmut run
-        
-        This will by default run pytest (or unittest if pytest is unavailable)
-        on tests in the "tests" or "test" folder and
-        it will try to figure out where the code to mutate lies.
-        
-        NOTE that mutmut will apply the mutations directly, one at a time;
-        it is **highly** recommended to add all changes to source control
-        before running.
-        
-        Enter
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mutmut run --help
-        
-        for the available flags, to use other runners, etc. The recommended way to use
-        mutmut if the defaults aren't working for you is to add a
-        block in ``setup.cfg`` or ``project.toml``.
-        Then when you come back to mutmut weeks later you don't have to figure out the
-        flags again, just run ``mutmut run`` and it works.
-        Like this in ``setup.cfg``:
-        
-        .. code-block:: ini
-        
-            [mutmut]
-            paths_to_mutate=src/
-            backup=False
-            runner=python -m hammett -x
-            tests_dir=tests/
-            dict_synonyms=Struct, NamedStruct
-        
-        or like this in ``pyproject.toml``:
-        
-        .. code-block:: ini
-        
-            [tool.mutmut]
-            paths_to_mutate="src"
-            runner="python -m hammett -x"
-        
-        To use multiple paths either in the ``paths_to_mutate`` or ``tests_dir`` option
-        use a comma or colon separated list. For example:
-        
-        .. code-block:: ini
-        
-            [mutmut]
-            paths_to_mutate=src/,src2/
-            tests_dir=tests/:tests2/
-        
-        You can stop the mutation run at any time and mutmut will restart where you
-        left off. It's also smart enough to retest only the surviving mutants when the
-        test suite changes.
-        
-        To print the results run ``mutmut show``. It will give you a list of the mutants
-        grouped by file. You can now look at a specific mutant diff with ``mutmut show 3``,
-        all mutants for a specific file with ``mutmut show path/to/file.py`` or all mutants
-        with ``mutmut show all``.
-        
-        You can also write a mutant to disk with ``mutmut apply 3``. You should **REALLY**
-        have the file you mutate under source code control and committed before you apply
-        a mutant!
-        
-        To generate a HTML report for a web browser: ``mutmut html``
-        
-        Whitelisting
-        ------------
-        
-        You can mark lines like this:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            some_code_here()  # pragma: no mutate
-        
-        to stop mutation on those lines. Some cases we've found where you need to
-        whitelist lines are:
-        
-        - The version string on your library. You really shouldn't have a test for this :P
-        - Optimizing break instead of continue. The code runs fine when mutating break
-          to continue, but it's slower.
-        
-        See also `Advanced whitelisting and configuration`_
-        
-

-        - Integer literals are changed by adding 1. So 0 becomes 1, 5 becomes 6, etc.
-        - ``<`` is changed to ``<=``
-        - break is changed to continue and vice versa
-        
-        In general the idea is that the mutations should be as subtle as possible.
-        See ``__init__.py`` for the full list.
-        
-        
-        Workflow
-        --------
-        
-        This section describes how to work with mutmut to enhance your test suite.
-        
-        1. Run mutmut with ``mutmut run``. A full run is preferred but if you're just
-           getting started you can exit in the middle and start working with what you
-           have found so far.
-        2. Show the mutants with ``mutmut results``
-        3. Apply a surviving mutant to disk running ``mutmut apply 3`` (replace 3 with
-           the relevant mutant ID from ``mutmut results``)
-        4. Write a new test that fails
-        5. Revert the mutant on disk
-        6. Rerun the new test to see that it now passes
-        7. Go back to point 2.
-        
-        Mutmut keeps a result cache in ``.mutmut-cache`` so if you want to make sure you
-        run a full mutmut run just delete this file.
-        
-        If you want to re-run all survivors after changing a lot of code or even the configuration,
-        you can use `for ID in $(mutmut result-ids survived); do mutmut run $ID; done` (for bash).
-        
-        You can also tell mutmut to just check a single mutant:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mutmut run 3
-        
-        
-        Advanced whitelisting and configuration
-        ---------------------------------------
-        
-        mutmut has an advanced configuration system. You create a file called
-        ``mutmut_config.py``. You can define two functions there: ``init()`` and
-        ``pre_mutation(context)``. ``init`` gets called when mutmut starts and
-        ``pre_mutation`` gets called before each mutant is applied and tested. You can
-        mutate the ``context`` object as you need. You can modify the test command like
-        this:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                context.config.test_command = 'python -m pytest -x ' + something_else
-        
-        or skip a mutant:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                if context.filename == 'foo.py':
-                    context.skip = True
-        
-        or skip logging:
-        
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                line = context.current_source_line.strip()
-                if line.startswith('log.'):
-                    context.skip = True
-        
-        look at the code for the ``Context`` class for what you can modify. Please
-        open a github issue if you need help.
-        
-        It is also possible to disable mutation of specific node types by passing the
-        ``--disable-mutation-types`` option. Multiple types can be specified by separating them
-        by comma:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mutmut run --disable-mutation-types=string,decorator
-        
-        Inversely, you can also only specify to only run specific mutations with ``--enable-mutation-types``.
-        Note that ``--disable-mutation-types`` and ``--enable-mutation-types`` are exclusive and cannot
-        be combined.
-        
-        
-        Selecting tests to run
-        ----------------------
-        
-        If you have a large test suite or long running tests, it can be beneficial to narrow the set of tests to
-        run for each mutant down to the tests that have a chance of killing it.
-        Determining the relevant subset of tests depends on your project, its structure, and the metadata that you
-        know about your tests.
-        ``mutmut`` provides information like the file to mutate and `coverage contexts <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/contexts.html>`_
-        (if used with the ``--use-coverage`` switch).
-        You can set the ``context.config.test_command`` in the ``pre_mutation(context)`` hook of ``mutmut_config.py``.
-        The ``test_command`` is reset after each mutant, so you don't have to explicitly (re)set it for each mutant.
-        
-        This section gives examples to show how this could be done for some concrete use cases.
-        All examples use the default test runner (``python -m pytest -x --assert=plain``).
-        
-        Selection based on source and test layout
-        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-        
-        If the location of the test module has a strict correlation with your source code layout, you can simply
-        construct the path to the corresponding test file from ``context.filename``.
-        Suppose your layout follows the following structure where the test file is always located right beside the
-        production code:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mypackage
-            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production_module.py
-            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_production_module.py
-            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subpackage
-                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ submodule.py
-                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_submodule.py
-        
-        Your ``mutmut_config.py`` in this case would look like this:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            import os.path
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                dirname, filename = os.path.split(context.filename)
-                testfile = "test_" + filename
-                context.config.test_command += ' ' + os.path.join(dirname, testfile)
-        
-        Selection based on imports
-        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-        
-        If you can't rely on the directory structure or naming of the test files, you may assume that the tests most likely
-        to kill the mutant are located in test files that directly import the module that is affected by the mutant.
-        Using the ``ast`` module of the Python standard library, you can use the ``init()`` hook to build a map which test file
-        imports which module, and then lookup all test files importing the mutated module and only run those:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            import ast
-            from pathlib import Path
-        
-            test_imports = {}
-        
-        
-            class ImportVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
-                """Visitor which records which modules are imported."""
-                def __init__(self) -> None:
-                    super().__init__()
-                    self.imports = []
-        
-                def visit_Import(self, node: ast.Import) -> None:
-                    for alias in node.names:
-                        self.imports.append(alias.name)
-        
-                def visit_ImportFrom(self, node: ast.ImportFrom) -> None:
-                    self.imports.append(node.module)
-        
-        
-            def init():
-                """Find all test files located under the 'tests' directory and create an abstract syntax tree for each.
-                Let the ``ImportVisitor`` find out what modules they import and store the information in a global dictionary
-                which can be accessed by ``pre_mutation(context)``."""
-                test_files = (Path(__file__).parent / "tests").rglob("test*.py")
-                for fpath in test_files:
-                    visitor = ImportVisitor()
-                    visitor.visit(ast.parse(fpath.read_bytes()))
-                    test_imports[str(fpath)] = visitor.imports
-        
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                """Construct the module name from the filename and run all test files which import that module."""
-                tests_to_run = []
-                for testfile, imports in test_imports.items():
-                    module_name = context.filename.rstrip(".py").replace("/", ".")
-                    if module_name in imports:
-                        tests_to_run.append(testfile)
-                context.config.test_command += f"{' '.join(tests_to_run)}"
-        
-        Selection based on coverage contexts
-        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-        
-        If you recorded `coverage contexts <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/contexts.html>`_ and use
-        the ``--use-coverage`` switch, you can access this coverage data inside the ``pre_mutation(context)`` hook
-        via the ``context.config.coverage_data`` attribute. This attribute is a dictionary in the form
-        ``{filename: {lineno: [contexts]}}``.
-        
-        Let's say you have used the built-in dynamic context option of ``Coverage.py`` by adding the following to
-        your ``.coveragerc`` file:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            [run]
-            dynamic_context = test_function
-        
-        ``coverage`` will create a new context for each test function that you run in the form ``module_name.function_name``.
-        With ``pytest``, we can use the ``-k`` switch to filter tests that match a given expression.
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            import os.path
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                """Extract the coverage contexts if possible and only run the tests matching this data."""
-                if not context.config.coverage_data:
-                    # mutmut was run without ``--use-coverage``
-                    return
-                fname = os.path.abspath(context.filename)
-                contexts_for_file = context.config.coverage_data.get(fname, {})
-                contexts_for_line = contexts_for_file.get(context.current_line_index, [])
-                test_names = [
-                    ctx.rsplit(".", 1)[-1]  # extract only the final part after the last dot, which is the test function name
-                    for ctx in contexts_for_line
-                    if ctx  # skip empty strings
-                ]
-                if not test_names:
-                    return
-                context.config.test_command += f' -k "{" or ".join(test_names)}"'
-        
-        Pay attention that the format of the context name varies depending on the tool you use for creating the contexts.
-        For example, the ``pytest-cov`` plugin uses ``::`` as separator between module and test function.
-        Furthermore, not all tools are able to correctly pick up the correct contexts. ``coverage.py`` for instance is (at the time of writing)
-        unable to pick up tests that are inside a class when using ``pytest``.
-        You will have to inspect your ``.coverage`` database using the `Coverage.py API <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/api.html>`_
-        first to determine how you can extract the correct information to use with your test runner.
-        
-        Making things more robust
-        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-        
-        Despite your best efforts in picking the right subset of tests, it may happen that the mutant survives because the test which is able
-        to kill it was not included in the test set. You can tell ``mutmut`` to re-run the full test suite in that case, to verify that this
-        mutant indeed survives.
-        You can do so by passing the ``--rerun-all`` option to ``mutmut run``. This option is disabled by default.
-        
-        
-        JUnit XML support
-        -----------------
-        
-        In order to better integrate with CI/CD systems, ``mutmut`` supports the
-        generation of a JUnit XML report (using https://pypi.org/project/junit-xml/).
-        This option is available by calling ``mutmut junitxml``. In order to define how
-        to deal with suspicious and untested mutants, you can use
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mutmut junitxml --suspicious-policy=ignore --untested-policy=ignore
-        
-        The possible values for these policies are:
-        
-        - ``ignore``: Do not include the results on the report at all
-        - ``skipped``: Include the mutant on the report as "skipped"
-        - ``error``: Include the mutant on the report as "error"
-        - ``failure``: Include the mutant on the report as "failure"
-        
-        If a failed mutant is included in the report, then the unified diff of the
-        mutant will also be included for debugging purposes.

+
+Mutmut is a mutation testing system for Python, with a strong focus on ease
+of use. If you don't know what mutation testing is try starting with
+`this article <https://hackernoon.com/mutmut-a-python-mutation-testing-system-9b9639356c78>`_.
+
+Some highlight features:
+
+- Found mutants can be applied on disk with a simple command making it very
+  easy to work with the results
+- Remembers work that has been done, so you can work incrementally
+- Supports all test runners (because mutmut only needs an exit code from the
+  test command)
+- If you use the `hammett <https://github.com/boxed/hammett>`_ test runner
+  you can go extremely fast! There's special handling for this runner
+  that has some pretty dramatic results.
+- Can use coverage data to only do mutation testing on covered lines
+- Battle tested on real libraries by multiple companies
+
+
+If you need to run mutmut on a python 2 code base use mutmut ``1.5.0``. Mutmut
+``1.9.0`` is the last version to support python ``3.4``, ``3.5`` and ``3.6``.
+
+
+Install and run
+---------------
+
+You can get started with a simple:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    pip install mutmut
+    mutmut run
+
+This will by default run pytest (or unittest if pytest is unavailable)
+on tests in the "tests" or "test" folder and
+it will try to figure out where the code to mutate lies.
+
+NOTE that mutmut will apply the mutations directly, one at a time;
+it is **highly** recommended to add all changes to source control
+before running.
+
+Enter
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    mutmut run --help
+
+for the available flags, to use other runners, etc. The recommended way to use
+mutmut if the defaults aren't working for you is to add a
+block in ``setup.cfg`` or ``project.toml``.
+Then when you come back to mutmut weeks later you don't have to figure out the
+flags again, just run ``mutmut run`` and it works.
+Like this in ``setup.cfg``:
+
+.. code-block:: ini
+
+    [mutmut]
+    paths_to_mutate=src/
+    backup=False
+    runner=python -m hammett -x
+    tests_dir=tests/
+    dict_synonyms=Struct, NamedStruct
+
+or like this in ``pyproject.toml``:
+
+.. code-block:: ini
+
+    [tool.mutmut]
+    paths_to_mutate="src"
+    runner="python -m hammett -x"
+
+To use multiple paths either in the ``paths_to_mutate`` or ``tests_dir`` option
+use a comma or colon separated list. For example:
+
+.. code-block:: ini
+
+    [mutmut]
+    paths_to_mutate=src/,src2/
+    tests_dir=tests/:tests2/
+
+You can stop the mutation run at any time and mutmut will restart where you
+left off. It's also smart enough to retest only the surviving mutants when the
+test suite changes.
+
+To print the results run ``mutmut show``. It will give you a list of the mutants
+grouped by file. You can now look at a specific mutant diff with ``mutmut show 3``,
+all mutants for a specific file with ``mutmut show path/to/file.py`` or all mutants
+with ``mutmut show all``.
+
+You can also write a mutant to disk with ``mutmut apply 3``. You should **REALLY**
+have the file you mutate under source code control and committed before you apply
+a mutant!
+
+To generate a HTML report for a web browser: ``mutmut html``
+
+Whitelisting
+------------
+
+You can mark lines like this:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    some_code_here()  # pragma: no mutate
+
+to stop mutation on those lines. Some cases we've found where you need to
+whitelist lines are:
+
+- The version string on your library. You really shouldn't have a test for this :P
+- Optimizing break instead of continue. The code runs fine when mutating break
+  to continue, but it's slower.
+
+See also `Advanced whitelisting and configuration`_
+
+
+Example mutations
+-----------------
+
+- Integer literals are changed by adding 1. So 0 becomes 1, 5 becomes 6, etc.
+- ``<`` is changed to ``<=``
+- break is changed to continue and vice versa
+
+In general the idea is that the mutations should be as subtle as possible.
+See ``__init__.py`` for the full list.
+
+
+Workflow
+--------
+
+This section describes how to work with mutmut to enhance your test suite.
+
+1. Run mutmut with ``mutmut run``. A full run is preferred but if you're just
+   getting started you can exit in the middle and start working with what you
+   have found so far.
+2. Show the mutants with ``mutmut results``
+3. Apply a surviving mutant to disk running ``mutmut apply 3`` (replace 3 with
+   the relevant mutant ID from ``mutmut results``)
+4. Write a new test that fails
+5. Revert the mutant on disk
+6. Rerun the new test to see that it now passes
+7. Go back to point 2.
+
+Mutmut keeps a result cache in ``.mutmut-cache`` so if you want to make sure you
+run a full mutmut run just delete this file.
+
+If you want to re-run all survivors after changing a lot of code or even the configuration,
+you can use `for ID in $(mutmut result-ids survived); do mutmut run $ID; done` (for bash).
+
+You can also tell mutmut to just check a single mutant:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    mutmut run 3
+
+
+Advanced whitelisting and configuration
+---------------------------------------
+
+mutmut has an advanced configuration system. You create a file called
+``mutmut_config.py``. You can define two functions there: ``init()`` and
+``pre_mutation(context)``. ``init`` gets called when mutmut starts and
+``pre_mutation`` gets called before each mutant is applied and tested. You can
+mutate the ``context`` object as you need. You can modify the test command like
+this:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        context.config.test_command = 'python -m pytest -x ' + something_else
+
+or skip a mutant:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        if context.filename == 'foo.py':
+            context.skip = True
+
+or skip logging:
+
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        line = context.current_source_line.strip()
+        if line.startswith('log.'):
+            context.skip = True
+
+look at the code for the ``Context`` class for what you can modify. Please
+open a github issue if you need help.
+
+It is also possible to disable mutation of specific node types by passing the
+``--disable-mutation-types`` option. Multiple types can be specified by separating them
+by comma:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    mutmut run --disable-mutation-types=string,decorator
+
+Inversely, you can also only specify to only run specific mutations with ``--enable-mutation-types``.
+Note that ``--disable-mutation-types`` and ``--enable-mutation-types`` are exclusive and cannot
+be combined.
+
+Changes made to ``mutmut_config.py`` does not invalidate the cache.
+If you modify the configuration file, you will likely need to remove ``.mutmut-cache`` manually to ensure that the changes take effect.
+
+Selecting tests to run
+----------------------
+
+If you have a large test suite or long running tests, it can be beneficial to narrow the set of tests to
+run for each mutant down to the tests that have a chance of killing it.
+Determining the relevant subset of tests depends on your project, its structure, and the metadata that you
+know about your tests.
+``mutmut`` provides information like the file to mutate and `coverage contexts <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/contexts.html>`_
+(if used with the ``--use-coverage`` switch).
+You can set the ``context.config.test_command`` in the ``pre_mutation(context)`` hook of ``mutmut_config.py``.
+The ``test_command`` is reset after each mutant, so you don't have to explicitly (re)set it for each mutant.
+
+This section gives examples to show how this could be done for some concrete use cases.
+All examples use the default test runner (``python -m pytest -x --assert=plain``).
+
+Selection based on source and test layout
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+If the location of the test module has a strict correlation with your source code layout, you can simply
+construct the path to the corresponding test file from ``context.filename``.
+Suppose your layout follows the following structure where the test file is always located right beside the
+production code:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    mypackage
+    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production_module.py
+    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_production_module.py
+    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subpackage
+        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ submodule.py
+        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_submodule.py
+
+Your ``mutmut_config.py`` in this case would look like this:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    import os.path
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        dirname, filename = os.path.split(context.filename)
+        testfile = "test_" + filename
+        context.config.test_command += ' ' + os.path.join(dirname, testfile)
+
+Selection based on imports
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+If you can't rely on the directory structure or naming of the test files, you may assume that the tests most likely
+to kill the mutant are located in test files that directly import the module that is affected by the mutant.
+Using the ``ast`` module of the Python standard library, you can use the ``init()`` hook to build a map which test file
+imports which module, and then lookup all test files importing the mutated module and only run those:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    import ast
+    from pathlib import Path
+
+    test_imports = {}
+
+
+    class ImportVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
+        """Visitor which records which modules are imported."""
+        def __init__(self) -> None:
+            super().__init__()
+            self.imports = []
+
+        def visit_Import(self, node: ast.Import) -> None:
+            for alias in node.names:
+                self.imports.append(alias.name)
+
+        def visit_ImportFrom(self, node: ast.ImportFrom) -> None:
+            self.imports.append(node.module)
+
+
+    def init():
+        """Find all test files located under the 'tests' directory and create an abstract syntax tree for each.
+        Let the ``ImportVisitor`` find out what modules they import and store the information in a global dictionary
+        which can be accessed by ``pre_mutation(context)``."""
+        test_files = (Path(__file__).parent / "tests").rglob("test*.py")
+        for fpath in test_files:
+            visitor = ImportVisitor()
+            visitor.visit(ast.parse(fpath.read_bytes()))
+            test_imports[str(fpath)] = visitor.imports
+
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        """Construct the module name from the filename and run all test files which import that module."""
+        tests_to_run = []
+        for testfile, imports in test_imports.items():
+            module_name = context.filename.rstrip(".py").replace("/", ".")
+            if module_name in imports:
+                tests_to_run.append(testfile)
+        context.config.test_command += f"{' '.join(tests_to_run)}"
+
+Selection based on coverage contexts
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+If you recorded `coverage contexts <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/contexts.html>`_ and use
+the ``--use-coverage`` switch, you can access this coverage data inside the ``pre_mutation(context)`` hook
+via the ``context.config.coverage_data`` attribute. This attribute is a dictionary in the form
+``{filename: {lineno: [contexts]}}``.
+
+Let's say you have used the built-in dynamic context option of ``Coverage.py`` by adding the following to
+your ``.coveragerc`` file:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    [run]
+    dynamic_context = test_function
+
+``coverage`` will create a new context for each test function that you run in the form ``module_name.function_name``.
+With ``pytest``, we can use the ``-k`` switch to filter tests that match a given expression.
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    import os.path
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        """Extract the coverage contexts if possible and only run the tests matching this data."""
+        if not context.config.coverage_data:
+            # mutmut was run without ``--use-coverage``
+            return
+        fname = os.path.abspath(context.filename)
+        contexts_for_file = context.config.coverage_data.get(fname, {})
+        contexts_for_line = contexts_for_file.get(context.current_line_index, [])
+        test_names = [
+            ctx.rsplit(".", 1)[-1]  # extract only the final part after the last dot, which is the test function name
+            for ctx in contexts_for_line
+            if ctx  # skip empty strings
+        ]
+        if not test_names:
+            return
+        context.config.test_command += f' -k "{" or ".join(test_names)}"'
+
+Pay attention that the format of the context name varies depending on the tool you use for creating the contexts.
+For example, the ``pytest-cov`` plugin uses ``::`` as separator between module and test function.
+Furthermore, not all tools are able to correctly pick up the correct contexts. ``coverage.py`` for instance is (at the time of writing)
+unable to pick up tests that are inside a class when using ``pytest``.
+You will have to inspect your ``.coverage`` database using the `Coverage.py API <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/api.html>`_
+first to determine how you can extract the correct information to use with your test runner.
+
+Making things more robust
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+Despite your best efforts in picking the right subset of tests, it may happen that the mutant survives because the test which is able
+to kill it was not included in the test set. You can tell ``mutmut`` to re-run the full test suite in that case, to verify that this
+mutant indeed survives.
+You can do so by passing the ``--rerun-all`` option to ``mutmut run``. This option is disabled by default.
+
+
+JUnit XML support
+-----------------
+
+In order to better integrate with CI/CD systems, ``mutmut`` supports the
+generation of a JUnit XML report (using https://pypi.org/project/junit-xml/).
+This option is available by calling ``mutmut junitxml``. In order to define how
+to deal with suspicious and untested mutants, you can use
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    mutmut junitxml --suspicious-policy=ignore --untested-policy=ignore
+
+The possible values for these policies are:
+
+- ``ignore``: Do not include the results on the report at all
+- ``skipped``: Include the mutant on the report as "skipped"
+- ``error``: Include the mutant on the report as "error"
+- ``failure``: Include the mutant on the report as "failure"
+
+If a failed mutant is included in the report, then the unified diff of the
+mutant will also be included for debugging purposes.

-        
-        Mutmut is a mutation testing system for Python, with a strong focus on ease
-        of use. If you don't know what mutation testing is try starting with
-        `this article <https://hackernoon.com/mutmut-a-python-mutation-testing-system-9b9639356c78>`_.
-        
-        Some highlight features:
-        
-        - Found mutants can be applied on disk with a simple command making it very
-          easy to work with the results
-        - Remembers work that has been done, so you can work incrementally
-        - Supports all test runners (because mutmut only needs an exit code from the
-          test command)
-        - If you use the `hammett <https://github.com/boxed/hammett>`_ test runner
-          you can go extremely fast! There's special handling for this runner
-          that has some pretty dramatic results.
-        - Can use coverage data to only do mutation testing on covered lines
-        - Battle tested on real libraries by multiple companies
-        
-        
-        If you need to run mutmut on a python 2 code base use mutmut ``1.5.0``. Mutmut
-        ``1.9.0`` is the last version to support python ``3.4``, ``3.5`` and ``3.6``.
-        
-        
-        Install and run
-        ---------------
-        
-        You can get started with a simple:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            pip install mutmut
-            mutmut run
-        
-        This will by default run pytest (or unittest if pytest is unavailable)
-        on tests in the "tests" or "test" folder and
-        it will try to figure out where the code to mutate lies.
-        
-        NOTE that mutmut will apply the mutations directly, one at a time;
-        it is **highly** recommended to add all changes to source control
-        before running.
-        
-        Enter
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mutmut run --help
-        
-        for the available flags, to use other runners, etc. The recommended way to use
-        mutmut if the defaults aren't working for you is to add a
-        block in ``setup.cfg`` or ``project.toml``.
-        Then when you come back to mutmut weeks later you don't have to figure out the
-        flags again, just run ``mutmut run`` and it works.
-        Like this in ``setup.cfg``:
-        
-        .. code-block:: ini
-        
-            [mutmut]
-            paths_to_mutate=src/
-            backup=False
-            runner=python -m hammett -x
-            tests_dir=tests/
-            dict_synonyms=Struct, NamedStruct
-        
-        or like this in ``pyproject.toml``:
-        
-        .. code-block:: ini
-        
-            [tool.mutmut]
-            paths_to_mutate="src"
-            runner="python -m hammett -x"
-        
-        To use multiple paths either in the ``paths_to_mutate`` or ``tests_dir`` option
-        use a comma or colon separated list. For example:
-        
-        .. code-block:: ini
-        
-            [mutmut]
-            paths_to_mutate=src/,src2/
-            tests_dir=tests/:tests2/
-        
-        You can stop the mutation run at any time and mutmut will restart where you
-        left off. It's also smart enough to retest only the surviving mutants when the
-        test suite changes.
-        
-        To print the results run ``mutmut show``. It will give you a list of the mutants
-        grouped by file. You can now look at a specific mutant diff with ``mutmut show 3``,
-        all mutants for a specific file with ``mutmut show path/to/file.py`` or all mutants
-        with ``mutmut show all``.
-        
-        You can also write a mutant to disk with ``mutmut apply 3``. You should **REALLY**
-        have the file you mutate under source code control and committed before you apply
-        a mutant!
-        
-        To generate a HTML report for a web browser: ``mutmut html``
-        
-        Whitelisting
-        ------------
-        
-        You can mark lines like this:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            some_code_here()  # pragma: no mutate
-        
-        to stop mutation on those lines. Some cases we've found where you need to
-        whitelist lines are:
-        
-        - The version string on your library. You really shouldn't have a test for this :P
-        - Optimizing break instead of continue. The code runs fine when mutating break
-          to continue, but it's slower.
-        
-        See also `Advanced whitelisting and configuration`_
-        
-        
-        Example mutations
-        -----------------
-        
-        - Integer literals are changed by adding 1. So 0 becomes 1, 5 becomes 6, etc.
-        - ``<`` is changed to ``<=``
-        - break is changed to continue and vice versa
-        
-        In general the idea is that the mutations should be as subtle as possible.
-        See ``__init__.py`` for the full list.
-        
-        
-        Workflow
-        --------
-        
-        This section describes how to work with mutmut to enhance your test suite.
-        
-        1. Run mutmut with ``mutmut run``. A full run is preferred but if you're just
-           getting started you can exit in the middle and start working with what you
-           have found so far.
-        2. Show the mutants with ``mutmut results``
-        3. Apply a surviving mutant to disk running ``mutmut apply 3`` (replace 3 with
-           the relevant mutant ID from ``mutmut results``)
-        4. Write a new test that fails
-        5. Revert the mutant on disk
-        6. Rerun the new test to see that it now passes
-        7. Go back to point 2.
-        
-        Mutmut keeps a result cache in ``.mutmut-cache`` so if you want to make sure you
-        run a full mutmut run just delete this file.
-        
-        If you want to re-run all survivors after changing a lot of code or even the configuration,
-        you can use `for ID in $(mutmut result-ids survived); do mutmut run $ID; done` (for bash).
-        
-        You can also tell mutmut to just check a single mutant:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mutmut run 3
-        
-        
-        Advanced whitelisting and configuration
-        ---------------------------------------
-        
-        mutmut has an advanced configuration system. You create a file called
-        ``mutmut_config.py``. You can define two functions there: ``init()`` and
-        ``pre_mutation(context)``. ``init`` gets called when mutmut starts and
-        ``pre_mutation`` gets called before each mutant is applied and tested. You can
-        mutate the ``context`` object as you need. You can modify the test command like
-        this:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                context.config.test_command = 'python -m pytest -x ' + something_else
-        
-        or skip a mutant:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                if context.filename == 'foo.py':
-                    context.skip = True
-        
-        or skip logging:
-        
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                line = context.current_source_line.strip()
-                if line.startswith('log.'):
-                    context.skip = True
-        
-        look at the code for the ``Context`` class for what you can modify. Please
-        open a github issue if you need help.
-        
-        It is also possible to disable mutation of specific node types by passing the
-        ``--disable-mutation-types`` option. Multiple types can be specified by separating them
-        by comma:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mutmut run --disable-mutation-types=string,decorator
-        
-        Inversely, you can also only specify to only run specific mutations with ``--enable-mutation-types``.
-        Note that ``--disable-mutation-types`` and ``--enable-mutation-types`` are exclusive and cannot
-        be combined.
-        
-        
-        Selecting tests to run
-        ----------------------
-        
-        If you have a large test suite or long running tests, it can be beneficial to narrow the set of tests to
-        run for each mutant down to the tests that have a chance of killing it.
-        Determining the relevant subset of tests depends on your project, its structure, and the metadata that you
-        know about your tests.
-        ``mutmut`` provides information like the file to mutate and `coverage contexts <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/contexts.html>`_
-        (if used with the ``--use-coverage`` switch).
-        You can set the ``context.config.test_command`` in the ``pre_mutation(context)`` hook of ``mutmut_config.py``.
-        The ``test_command`` is reset after each mutant, so you don't have to explicitly (re)set it for each mutant.
-        
-        This section gives examples to show how this could be done for some concrete use cases.
-        All examples use the default test runner (``python -m pytest -x --assert=plain``).
-        
-        Selection based on source and test layout
-        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-        
-        If the location of the test module has a strict correlation with your source code layout, you can simply
-        construct the path to the corresponding test file from ``context.filename``.
-        Suppose your layout follows the following structure where the test file is always located right beside the
-        production code:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mypackage
-            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production_module.py
-            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_production_module.py
-            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subpackage
-                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ submodule.py
-                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_submodule.py
-        
-        Your ``mutmut_config.py`` in this case would look like this:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            import os.path
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                dirname, filename = os.path.split(context.filename)
-                testfile = "test_" + filename
-                context.config.test_command += ' ' + os.path.join(dirname, testfile)
-        
-        Selection based on imports
-        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-        
-        If you can't rely on the directory structure or naming of the test files, you may assume that the tests most likely
-        to kill the mutant are located in test files that directly import the module that is affected by the mutant.
-        Using the ``ast`` module of the Python standard library, you can use the ``init()`` hook to build a map which test file
-        imports which module, and then lookup all test files importing the mutated module and only run those:
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            import ast
-            from pathlib import Path
-        
-            test_imports = {}
-        
-        
-            class ImportVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
-                """Visitor which records which modules are imported."""
-                def __init__(self) -> None:
-                    super().__init__()
-                    self.imports = []
-        
-                def visit_Import(self, node: ast.Import) -> None:
-                    for alias in node.names:
-                        self.imports.append(alias.name)
-        
-                def visit_ImportFrom(self, node: ast.ImportFrom) -> None:
-                    self.imports.append(node.module)
-        
-        
-            def init():
-                """Find all test files located under the 'tests' directory and create an abstract syntax tree for each.
-                Let the ``ImportVisitor`` find out what modules they import and store the information in a global dictionary
-                which can be accessed by ``pre_mutation(context)``."""
-                test_files = (Path(__file__).parent / "tests").rglob("test*.py")
-                for fpath in test_files:
-                    visitor = ImportVisitor()
-                    visitor.visit(ast.parse(fpath.read_bytes()))
-                    test_imports[str(fpath)] = visitor.imports
-        
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                """Construct the module name from the filename and run all test files which import that module."""
-                tests_to_run = []
-                for testfile, imports in test_imports.items():
-                    module_name = context.filename.rstrip(".py").replace("/", ".")
-                    if module_name in imports:
-                        tests_to_run.append(testfile)
-                context.config.test_command += f"{' '.join(tests_to_run)}"
-        
-        Selection based on coverage contexts
-        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-        
-        If you recorded `coverage contexts <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/contexts.html>`_ and use
-        the ``--use-coverage`` switch, you can access this coverage data inside the ``pre_mutation(context)`` hook
-        via the ``context.config.coverage_data`` attribute. This attribute is a dictionary in the form
-        ``{filename: {lineno: [contexts]}}``.
-        
-        Let's say you have used the built-in dynamic context option of ``Coverage.py`` by adding the following to
-        your ``.coveragerc`` file:
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            [run]
-            dynamic_context = test_function
-        
-        ``coverage`` will create a new context for each test function that you run in the form ``module_name.function_name``.
-        With ``pytest``, we can use the ``-k`` switch to filter tests that match a given expression.
-        
-        .. code-block:: python
-        
-            import os.path
-        
-            def pre_mutation(context):
-                """Extract the coverage contexts if possible and only run the tests matching this data."""
-                if not context.config.coverage_data:
-                    # mutmut was run without ``--use-coverage``
-                    return
-                fname = os.path.abspath(context.filename)
-                contexts_for_file = context.config.coverage_data.get(fname, {})
-                contexts_for_line = contexts_for_file.get(context.current_line_index, [])
-                test_names = [
-                    ctx.rsplit(".", 1)[-1]  # extract only the final part after the last dot, which is the test function name
-                    for ctx in contexts_for_line
-                    if ctx  # skip empty strings
-                ]
-                if not test_names:
-                    return
-                context.config.test_command += f' -k "{" or ".join(test_names)}"'
-        
-        Pay attention that the format of the context name varies depending on the tool you use for creating the contexts.
-        For example, the ``pytest-cov`` plugin uses ``::`` as separator between module and test function.
-        Furthermore, not all tools are able to correctly pick up the correct contexts. ``coverage.py`` for instance is (at the time of writing)
-        unable to pick up tests that are inside a class when using ``pytest``.
-        You will have to inspect your ``.coverage`` database using the `Coverage.py API <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/api.html>`_
-        first to determine how you can extract the correct information to use with your test runner.
-        
-        Making things more robust
-        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-        
-        Despite your best efforts in picking the right subset of tests, it may happen that the mutant survives because the test which is able
-        to kill it was not included in the test set. You can tell ``mutmut`` to re-run the full test suite in that case, to verify that this
-        mutant indeed survives.
-        You can do so by passing the ``--rerun-all`` option to ``mutmut run``. This option is disabled by default.
-        
-        
-        JUnit XML support
-        -----------------
-        
-        In order to better integrate with CI/CD systems, ``mutmut`` supports the
-        generation of a JUnit XML report (using https://pypi.org/project/junit-xml/).
-        This option is available by calling ``mutmut junitxml``. In order to define how
-        to deal with suspicious and untested mutants, you can use
-        
-        .. code-block:: console
-        
-            mutmut junitxml --suspicious-policy=ignore --untested-policy=ignore
-        
-        The possible values for these policies are:
-        
-        - ``ignore``: Do not include the results on the report at all
-        - ``skipped``: Include the mutant on the report as "skipped"
-        - ``error``: Include the mutant on the report as "error"
-        - ``failure``: Include the mutant on the report as "failure"
-        
-        If a failed mutant is included in the report, then the unified diff of the
-        mutant will also be included for debugging purposes.

+
+Mutmut is a mutation testing system for Python, with a strong focus on ease
+of use. If you don't know what mutation testing is try starting with
+`this article <https://hackernoon.com/mutmut-a-python-mutation-testing-system-9b9639356c78>`_.
+
+Some highlight features:
+
+- Found mutants can be applied on disk with a simple command making it very
+  easy to work with the results
+- Remembers work that has been done, so you can work incrementally
+- Supports all test runners (because mutmut only needs an exit code from the
+  test command)
+- If you use the `hammett <https://github.com/boxed/hammett>`_ test runner
+  you can go extremely fast! There's special handling for this runner
+  that has some pretty dramatic results.
+- Can use coverage data to only do mutation testing on covered lines
+- Battle tested on real libraries by multiple companies
+
+
+If you need to run mutmut on a python 2 code base use mutmut ``1.5.0``. Mutmut
+``1.9.0`` is the last version to support python ``3.4``, ``3.5`` and ``3.6``.
+
+
+Install and run
+---------------
+
+You can get started with a simple:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    pip install mutmut
+    mutmut run
+
+This will by default run pytest (or unittest if pytest is unavailable)
+on tests in the "tests" or "test" folder and
+it will try to figure out where the code to mutate lies.
+
+NOTE that mutmut will apply the mutations directly, one at a time;
+it is **highly** recommended to add all changes to source control
+before running.
+
+Enter
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    mutmut run --help
+
+for the available flags, to use other runners, etc. The recommended way to use
+mutmut if the defaults aren't working for you is to add a
+block in ``setup.cfg`` or ``project.toml``.
+Then when you come back to mutmut weeks later you don't have to figure out the
+flags again, just run ``mutmut run`` and it works.
+Like this in ``setup.cfg``:
+
+.. code-block:: ini
+
+    [mutmut]
+    paths_to_mutate=src/
+    backup=False
+    runner=python -m hammett -x
+    tests_dir=tests/
+    dict_synonyms=Struct, NamedStruct
+
+or like this in ``pyproject.toml``:
+
+.. code-block:: ini
+
+    [tool.mutmut]
+    paths_to_mutate="src"
+    runner="python -m hammett -x"
+
+To use multiple paths either in the ``paths_to_mutate`` or ``tests_dir`` option
+use a comma or colon separated list. For example:
+
+.. code-block:: ini
+
+    [mutmut]
+    paths_to_mutate=src/,src2/
+    tests_dir=tests/:tests2/
+
+You can stop the mutation run at any time and mutmut will restart where you
+left off. It's also smart enough to retest only the surviving mutants when the
+test suite changes.
+
+To print the results run ``mutmut show``. It will give you a list of the mutants
+grouped by file. You can now look at a specific mutant diff with ``mutmut show 3``,
+all mutants for a specific file with ``mutmut show path/to/file.py`` or all mutants
+with ``mutmut show all``.
+
+You can also write a mutant to disk with ``mutmut apply 3``. You should **REALLY**
+have the file you mutate under source code control and committed before you apply
+a mutant!
+
+To generate a HTML report for a web browser: ``mutmut html``
+
+Whitelisting
+------------
+
+You can mark lines like this:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    some_code_here()  # pragma: no mutate
+
+to stop mutation on those lines. Some cases we've found where you need to
+whitelist lines are:
+
+- The version string on your library. You really shouldn't have a test for this :P
+- Optimizing break instead of continue. The code runs fine when mutating break
+  to continue, but it's slower.
+
+See also `Advanced whitelisting and configuration`_
+
+
+Example mutations
+-----------------
+
+- Integer literals are changed by adding 1. So 0 becomes 1, 5 becomes 6, etc.
+- ``<`` is changed to ``<=``
+- break is changed to continue and vice versa
+
+In general the idea is that the mutations should be as subtle as possible.
+See ``__init__.py`` for the full list.
+
+
+Workflow
+--------
+
+This section describes how to work with mutmut to enhance your test suite.
+
+1. Run mutmut with ``mutmut run``. A full run is preferred but if you're just
+   getting started you can exit in the middle and start working with what you
+   have found so far.
+2. Show the mutants with ``mutmut results``
+3. Apply a surviving mutant to disk running ``mutmut apply 3`` (replace 3 with
+   the relevant mutant ID from ``mutmut results``)
+4. Write a new test that fails
+5. Revert the mutant on disk
+6. Rerun the new test to see that it now passes
+7. Go back to point 2.
+
+Mutmut keeps a result cache in ``.mutmut-cache`` so if you want to make sure you
+run a full mutmut run just delete this file.
+
+If you want to re-run all survivors after changing a lot of code or even the configuration,
+you can use `for ID in $(mutmut result-ids survived); do mutmut run $ID; done` (for bash).
+
+You can also tell mutmut to just check a single mutant:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    mutmut run 3
+
+
+Advanced whitelisting and configuration
+---------------------------------------
+
+mutmut has an advanced configuration system. You create a file called
+``mutmut_config.py``. You can define two functions there: ``init()`` and
+``pre_mutation(context)``. ``init`` gets called when mutmut starts and
+``pre_mutation`` gets called before each mutant is applied and tested. You can
+mutate the ``context`` object as you need. You can modify the test command like
+this:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        context.config.test_command = 'python -m pytest -x ' + something_else
+
+or skip a mutant:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        if context.filename == 'foo.py':
+            context.skip = True
+
+or skip logging:
+
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        line = context.current_source_line.strip()
+        if line.startswith('log.'):
+            context.skip = True
+
+look at the code for the ``Context`` class for what you can modify. Please
+open a github issue if you need help.
+
+It is also possible to disable mutation of specific node types by passing the
+``--disable-mutation-types`` option. Multiple types can be specified by separating them
+by comma:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    mutmut run --disable-mutation-types=string,decorator
+
+Inversely, you can also only specify to only run specific mutations with ``--enable-mutation-types``.
+Note that ``--disable-mutation-types`` and ``--enable-mutation-types`` are exclusive and cannot
+be combined.
+
+Changes made to ``mutmut_config.py`` does not invalidate the cache.
+If you modify the configuration file, you will likely need to remove ``.mutmut-cache`` manually to ensure that the changes take effect.
+
+Selecting tests to run
+----------------------
+
+If you have a large test suite or long running tests, it can be beneficial to narrow the set of tests to
+run for each mutant down to the tests that have a chance of killing it.
+Determining the relevant subset of tests depends on your project, its structure, and the metadata that you
+know about your tests.
+``mutmut`` provides information like the file to mutate and `coverage contexts <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/contexts.html>`_
+(if used with the ``--use-coverage`` switch).
+You can set the ``context.config.test_command`` in the ``pre_mutation(context)`` hook of ``mutmut_config.py``.
+The ``test_command`` is reset after each mutant, so you don't have to explicitly (re)set it for each mutant.
+
+This section gives examples to show how this could be done for some concrete use cases.
+All examples use the default test runner (``python -m pytest -x --assert=plain``).
+
+Selection based on source and test layout
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+If the location of the test module has a strict correlation with your source code layout, you can simply
+construct the path to the corresponding test file from ``context.filename``.
+Suppose your layout follows the following structure where the test file is always located right beside the
+production code:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+

+Your ``mutmut_config.py`` in this case would look like this:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    import os.path
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        dirname, filename = os.path.split(context.filename)
+        testfile = "test_" + filename
+        context.config.test_command += ' ' + os.path.join(dirname, testfile)
+
+Selection based on imports
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+If you can't rely on the directory structure or naming of the test files, you may assume that the tests most likely
+to kill the mutant are located in test files that directly import the module that is affected by the mutant.
+Using the ``ast`` module of the Python standard library, you can use the ``init()`` hook to build a map which test file
+imports which module, and then lookup all test files importing the mutated module and only run those:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    import ast
+    from pathlib import Path
+
+    test_imports = {}
+
+
+    class ImportVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
+        """Visitor which records which modules are imported."""
+        def __init__(self) -> None:
+            super().__init__()
+            self.imports = []
+
+        def visit_Import(self, node: ast.Import) -> None:
+            for alias in node.names:
+                self.imports.append(alias.name)
+
+        def visit_ImportFrom(self, node: ast.ImportFrom) -> None:
+            self.imports.append(node.module)
+
+
+    def init():
+        """Find all test files located under the 'tests' directory and create an abstract syntax tree for each.
+        Let the ``ImportVisitor`` find out what modules they import and store the information in a global dictionary
+        which can be accessed by ``pre_mutation(context)``."""
+        test_files = (Path(__file__).parent / "tests").rglob("test*.py")
+        for fpath in test_files:
+            visitor = ImportVisitor()
+            visitor.visit(ast.parse(fpath.read_bytes()))
+            test_imports[str(fpath)] = visitor.imports
+
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        """Construct the module name from the filename and run all test files which import that module."""
+        tests_to_run = []
+        for testfile, imports in test_imports.items():
+            module_name = context.filename.rstrip(".py").replace("/", ".")
+            if module_name in imports:
+                tests_to_run.append(testfile)
+        context.config.test_command += f"{' '.join(tests_to_run)}"
+
+Selection based on coverage contexts
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+If you recorded `coverage contexts <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/contexts.html>`_ and use
+the ``--use-coverage`` switch, you can access this coverage data inside the ``pre_mutation(context)`` hook
+via the ``context.config.coverage_data`` attribute. This attribute is a dictionary in the form
+``{filename: {lineno: [contexts]}}``.
+
+Let's say you have used the built-in dynamic context option of ``Coverage.py`` by adding the following to
+your ``.coveragerc`` file:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    [run]
+    dynamic_context = test_function
+
+``coverage`` will create a new context for each test function that you run in the form ``module_name.function_name``.
+With ``pytest``, we can use the ``-k`` switch to filter tests that match a given expression.
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    import os.path
+
+    def pre_mutation(context):
+        """Extract the coverage contexts if possible and only run the tests matching this data."""
+        if not context.config.coverage_data:
+            # mutmut was run without ``--use-coverage``
+            return
+        fname = os.path.abspath(context.filename)
+        contexts_for_file = context.config.coverage_data.get(fname, {})
+        contexts_for_line = contexts_for_file.get(context.current_line_index, [])
+        test_names = [
+            ctx.rsplit(".", 1)[-1]  # extract only the final part after the last dot, which is the test function name
+            for ctx in contexts_for_line
+            if ctx  # skip empty strings
+        ]
+        if not test_names:
+            return
+        context.config.test_command += f' -k "{" or ".join(test_names)}"'
+
+Pay attention that the format of the context name varies depending on the tool you use for creating the contexts.
+For example, the ``pytest-cov`` plugin uses ``::`` as separator between module and test function.
+Furthermore, not all tools are able to correctly pick up the correct contexts. ``coverage.py`` for instance is (at the time of writing)
+unable to pick up tests that are inside a class when using ``pytest``.
+You will have to inspect your ``.coverage`` database using the `Coverage.py API <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/api.html>`_
+first to determine how you can extract the correct information to use with your test runner.
+
+Making things more robust
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+Despite your best efforts in picking the right subset of tests, it may happen that the mutant survives because the test which is able
+to kill it was not included in the test set. You can tell ``mutmut`` to re-run the full test suite in that case, to verify that this
+mutant indeed survives.
+You can do so by passing the ``--rerun-all`` option to ``mutmut run``. This option is disabled by default.
+
+
+JUnit XML support
+-----------------
+
+In order to better integrate with CI/CD systems, ``mutmut`` supports the
+generation of a JUnit XML report (using https://pypi.org/project/junit-xml/).
+This option is available by calling ``mutmut junitxml``. In order to define how
+to deal with suspicious and untested mutants, you can use
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+    mutmut junitxml --suspicious-policy=ignore --untested-policy=ignore
+
+The possible values for these policies are:
+
+- ``ignore``: Do not include the results on the report at all
+- ``skipped``: Include the mutant on the report as "skipped"
+- ``error``: Include the mutant on the report as "error"
+- ``failure``: Include the mutant on the report as "failure"
+
+If a failed mutant is included in the report, then the unified diff of the
+mutant will also be included for debugging purposes.
